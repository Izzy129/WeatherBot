# Barabot
yet another multipurpose discord bot

will add a feature list and help later 


## usage
1. Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download). I use v16.13.0, so if the bot isn't working and you are on another version try that version.
2. Install compiled [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for your system. The latest version should work fine.
3. Clone the repository via `git clone https://github.com/Izzy129/barabot.git` or downloading ZIP through GitHub
5. Extract/Open the project, and do `npm install` to install the required dependencies 
6. Make a file named `.env`  using `.sampleenv` for the required values. Fill in the required values (tokens, api keys, etc.)
7. Deploy slash commands to your bot by doing `node deploy-commands.js`
8. Run the bot using `node .`
